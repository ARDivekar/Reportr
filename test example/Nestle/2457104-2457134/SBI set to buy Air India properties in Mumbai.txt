__HEADLINE__:SBI set to buy Air India properties in Mumbai


__ALT HEADLINE__:SBI said to be waiting for Air India to complete its side of approvals


__ARTICLE TEXT__:Mumbai/New Delhi: The countrys largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has received all necessary approvals to buy residential properties of cash-starved state-owned carrier Air India Ltd in south Mumbai for Rs.90 crore. 
The bank has got all the required approvals and it has conveyed its willingness to buy the properties from Air India. SBI is now waiting for the airline to complete its side of approvals, people close to development said. The state-owned bank is planning to allocate these flats to its top executives of the rank of deputy managing directors and general managers. The airline had been looking for buyers who can purchase its four flats at up-market Peddar Road in south Mumbai for the last two years. 
In August 2013, the airline had floated bids for e-auctioning of these four flats. Each of these 3-BHK flats measures 2,033 sq ft in carpet area. Confirming the communication from the bank on the proposed real estate deal, an Air India official said the airline has sent the proposal to the civil aviation ministry for its approval. The proposal is now with the Ministry for its approval, the official said. 
Air India has some working capital borrowings from SBI, besides long-term loans. The funds raised from the sale proceeds would help reduce this working capital loan besides reducing the interest outgo, people in the airline familiar with the matter had earlier said. The decision to sell these flats is part of the national carriers plan to unlock the value in its land assets. Under the land monetization plan, Air India plans to mop up Rs.5,000 crore over a 10-year period in its bid to bridge the mismatch in its revenue and expenditure.
