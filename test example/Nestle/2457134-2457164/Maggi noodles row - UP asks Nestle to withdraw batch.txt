__ALT HEADLINE__:Maggi Noodles row: Nestle India has been asked to withdraw a batch of Maggi noodles from the market after it was found to contain high level of lead.


__ARTICLE TEXT__:Nestle India has been asked to withdraw a batch of popular snack Maggi noodles from the market after it was found to contain high level of lead, Uttar Pradesh Food Safety and Drug Administration officials said.
While a company spokesperson did not reply to repeated calls and emails queries sent for comments in this regard, UP FDA officials said the order pertained to a 2014 batch of Maggi noodles.
Confirming the order asking Nestle to recall a batch of Maggi noodles, Additional Commissioner Ram Arya Maurya said, Whatever action we had to take we have taken. I dont wish to say anything more.
Tests of the said batch had also reportedly found high levels of added monosodium glutamate (MSG), a taste enhancer, in the noodles.
Sources close to the company said Nestle has contested the findings and said subsequent batches have passed all the tests.
They also contested the conclusion based on testing of just one pack of Maggi noodles.
Nestle India, a subsidiary of Swiss conglomerate Nestle SA sells instant noodle, ketchups, sauces under the Maggi brand.
It has around 60 per cent market share in the instant noodle category.
