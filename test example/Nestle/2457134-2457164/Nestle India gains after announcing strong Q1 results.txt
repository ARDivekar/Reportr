Nestle India said that net sales rose 8.4% to Rs 2506.80 crore in Q1 March 2015 over Q1 March 2014. Net domestic sales rose 7.6% mainly on account of higher realisations. Export sales grew 19.2% contributed largely by export of milk & nutrition products to Bangladesh and Middle East.
The impact of declining prices of fresh milk and derivatives compared to the increasing trend in previous year, was mostly negated by the opening stock of finished goods that was manufactured when fresh milk prices were relatively higher. However, cost of materials consumed as percentage of net sales has decreased largely due to selling price increases including carry over pricing.
Nestle India said that the board of directors of the company has declared interim dividend of Rs 14 for the year ended 31 December 2015 (FY 2015).
