__HEADLINE__:Nestle stock dives 11% as its Maggi troubles mount


__ARTICLE TEXT__:MUMBAI: As the controversy over the amount of lead present in  Maggi instant noodles snowballed across India, the stock price of  Nestle crashed over 11% in intra-day trades on Wednesday and closed 9% lower. The strong selling came after several brokerages, because of the recent controversy which is likely to affect its sales in the country, downgraded the stock sharply and asked their clients to offload their holdings in the company.
Times poll: Maggi at home  would you eat it?
On Wednesday, the Nestle stock on the BSE opened at Rs 6,533, down over 4% from its previous close at Rs 6,800 and touched an intra-day low at Rs 6,000, a slide of nearly 12% but closed off its low at Rs 6,191, down 9% on the day. As a result, in just one session the company's shareholders lost nearly Rs 6,000 crore, or close to a billion dollars, with the company's market capitalization now at nearly Rs 59,700 crore.
The strong slide in the stock price came after analysts from leading foreign brokerages like CLSA and Merrill Lynch, along with domestic majors like Edelweiss and Destimoney asked their clients to sell the stock. Leading foreign brokerage CLSA, in its report 'Maggi: More than just 2-minute trouble', pointed out that with Maggi instant noodle contributing about 20% to Nestle India's total revenues of Rs 9,806 crore in 2014, the regulatory troubles will impact its sales in 2015.
Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock on Wednesday to Rs 5,700 from around Rs 6,300 level earlier due to the recent controversy. Phillip Capital too downgraded the stock with a price target of Rs 5,110 "considering significant regulatory risks, possible erosion of brand value, risks to market share and expensive valuations".
