__HEADLINE__:Nestle feels the heat over Maggi row, stock crashes over 10%


__ARTICLE TEXT__:MUMBAI: Shares of  Nestle India slumped over 10% on Wednesday amid growing concerns about safety standards of its popular Maggi noodles.
Samples of  Maggi noodles taken in the national capital were found "unsafe" for consumption during tests by the Delhi government, which decided to initiate a case against Nestle India.
The stock plunged 10.10 per cent to Rs 6,119.40 on BSE. On NSE, it fell sharply by 10.2 per cent to Rs 6,109. A Bihar court yesterday ordered an FIR against Maggi brand ambassadors Amitabh Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit and Preity Zinta even as Nestle India faced trouble in more states.
It said officials of Nestle will be summoned in the next few days and more action may follow, including a possible ban on the famous '2-minute' instant noodle, after the final lab test report is received.
State-owned retail outlets in Kerala were asked to withdraw these products, and Karnataka and Haryana ordered random lifting of samples for scrutiny.

The Union Health Ministry said it will look into the matter, taking note of various reports suggesting that the samples of Maggi contained higher-than-permissible levels of lead and monosodium glutamate.
Meanwhile, BSE has sought clarification from Nestle India with reference to reports that the Maggi samples failed safety test in Delhi.
