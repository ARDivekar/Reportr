__ARTICLE TEXT__:Goa government is working on a plan to set up an institution similar to the Nagpur-headquartered Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM) in the state which will be mandated with certification and monitoring of mining industry.     Sources in the State Mines Department stated that during the recently held co-ordination cum empowered committee (CCEC) meeting of Union Mines department in New Delhi, Goa government was asked to have a IBM-like institution in the State.The meeting was chaired by Secretary (Mines) Anup Pujari."The matter has been put up for consideration of Union government whether Goa can have a separate mechanism parallel to IBM," a senior mines department official said pointing out to the minutes of the meeting held on April 22 and details of which are published on mines ministry website recently.The original idea of having IBM-like mechanism in Goa was discussed in the CCEC meeting held on March 13, 2015, which had discussed about the establishment of a system for preparation, certification and monitoring of the mining plans.Goa has iron ore mining industry which has currently come to standstill after the Supreme Court's ban.The Centre's move to have separate mechanism comes in the wake of recent Mines and Minerals Development Regulations (MMDR) amendment ordinance, 2015 which has given responsibility to the state government for approval of mining plan, scheme of mining and final closure plan and recognition of qualified persons for preparing mining plans.
